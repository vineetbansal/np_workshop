# Introduction to Numpy

These are jupyter notebooks for an introductory course on numpy.

#### Pre-flight check

We will be using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for this course. Anaconda is a popular software that gives us everything we need to get started in Python - the Python 3.8 interpreter, common Python libraries for scientific computing, plotting and analysis, jupyter Notebooks, and a lightweight IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for more advanced users.

Please make sure that you have `Python 3.8 version` installed for your platform (Windows/Mac/Linux). All users can select `64-bit Graphical Installer` unless you know that you have an older 32-bit operating system.

Advanced users may just choose to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). If you do so, please make sure that you have numpy, matplotlib, and notebook libraries installed.
```
conda install numpy matplotlib notebook
```
